// In JavaScript, prototypal inheritance is a way of creating objects and establishing relationships between them. It is based on the idea of prototypes, which are objects that serve as templates for other objects.

// In prototypal inheritance, an object can inherit properties and methods from another object, called its prototype.

// JavaScript uses the Object.create() method to create a new object that inherits from a specified prototype object.
