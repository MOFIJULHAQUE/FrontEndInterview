    <h1>Event delegation is a technique in which we attach a single event listener to a parent element, and then use
        logic to determine which child element the event occurred on.</h1>
    <p>Event delegation is a technique in which an event handler is added to a parent element rather than to individual
        child elements. The event handler will then check the target of the event to determine if it should take any
        action. This can be more efficient than adding event handlers to many child elements, especially if the child
        elements are dynamically added or removed from the page.</p>
