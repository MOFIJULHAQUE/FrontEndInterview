    <h1>Event bubbling is a mechanism in which an event is propagated from the innermost element (child) to the
    outermost element (parent) in the DOM tree.</h1>
    <p>Event bubbling is a mechanism in JavaScript where an event on a child element will propagate to its parent element. For example, if a click event occurs on a button within a div, the click event will also be triggered
    on the div. This allows for event handlers to be added to parent elements in order to catch events from multiple
    child elements.</p>

    <div id="parent">
        <div id="child1">
            <button id="btn">Click me</button>
        </div>
    </div>
